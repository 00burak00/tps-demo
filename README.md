# Third Person Shooter Demo

![Screenshot of TPS demo](screenshot.png)

Third person shooter demo made using [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) 3.1.

**Note:** Until Godot 3.1-stable is released, you need a recent build from Godot's
*master* branch to run this demo. You can build the engine from source, or use one
of @Calinou's [nightly builds](https://hugo.pro/projects/godot-builds).

**Note 2:** The repository is big and asset importing not well optimized yet, so expect
a high CPU and RAM load when opening the project for the first time.

## Git LFS

This demo uses [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to store the heaviest assets.

You need to install Git LFS on your system, and then fetch the assets from the LFS
repository with:

```text
git lfs fetch
git checkout master
```
